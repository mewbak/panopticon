//! Panopticon is a free/libre disassembler and binary analysis tool. It started as
//! platform for experiments in static program analysis and grew into a complete
//! library (libpanopticon) and a Qt 5 based UI. The library is written in C++, the
//! UI is a mix of C++ and QML. Both are licensed as GPLv3.
//!
//! Library Overview
//! ----------------
//!
//! The libpanopticon implements structures to model in-memory representation of a
//! program including is control flow, call graph, structured data and memory maps.
//! The most important types and their interaction are as follows:
//!
//! .. graphviz::
//!
//!   digraph G {
//!       rankdir=LR
//!       graph [bgcolor="transparent"]
//!       node [shape=rect]
//!       session -> database [label="contains"]
//!       database -> program [label="contains"]
//!       program -> procedure [label="contains"]
//!       procedure -> basic_block [label="contains"]
//!       basic_block -> mnemonic [label="contains"]
//!       mnemonic -> instr [label="contains"]
//!       database -> region [label="contains"]
//!       region -> layer [label="contains"]
//!       database -> structure [label="contains"]
//!       structure -> field [label="contains"]
//!   }
//!
//! The program, procedure, basic_block and instr types model the behaviour of code,
//! structure and field the meaning of data. The region and layer types represent
//! how the program is laid out in memory.
//!
//! Aside from these there are the storage, blob an :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>` types that manage
//! serialization of Panopticon types into an on-disk format.
//!
//! Code
//! ~~~~
//!
//! Panopticon models code as a collection of programs contained in a file. Each
//! program consists of procedures (e.g. functions). A procedure is a control flow
//! graph, e.g. a graph with nodes representing a sequence of instructions and
//! directed edges for (un)conditional jumps. These instruction sequences are basic
//! blocks and contain a list of mnemonics. Panopticon models the semantic of each
//! mnemonic using its own language called :ref:`PIL <pil>`. Each mnemonic instance
//! has a sequence of PIL instructions (:cpp:class:`instr` type) implementing it.
//!
//! Panopticon allows multiple programs per session. An example for that would be a
//! C# application that calls functions of a DLL written in C. Such an application
//! would have two program instances. One for the CIL code of the C# program and one
//! for the amd64 of ia32 object code of the DLL.
//!
//! One of the key features of Panopticon is the ability to "understand" the binary.
//! The disassembler not only knowns about the shape of mnemonics (its syntax) but
//! also what is does (the semantics). Each mnemonics includes a short program in PIL
//! the implements the mnemonic. This allows sophisticated analysis like symbolic
//! execution, automatic crafting of input to reach certain basic blocks,
//! decompilation and computing bounds on register values without executing the code.
//!
//! Instances of the program, procedure, basic_block and instr types are created by
//! the disassembler subsystem (disassembler and code_generator types). A
//! disassembler is given a range of data and an instruction set architecture and
//! creates a model of the code found in the data.
//!
//! .. Overview data: field and structure
//!
//! Sources
//! ~~~~~~~
//!
//! The in-memory layout of an executable is modeled using the region, layer and
//! tryte types. All data is organized into regions. Each region is an array of
//! cells numbered from 0 to n. Each cell is an tryte instance that is either
//! undefined or has a value between 0 and 255 (both including). Regions are read
//! only. Changing their contents is done by applying layer instance to them. A layer
//! reads part of a region or another layer and returns a new tryte array. Layers
//! can for example decrypt parts of a region or replace individual trytes with new
//! ones.
//!
//! In normal operation there is one region for each memory address space, one on
//! Von-Neumann machines two on Harvard architectures. Other uses for regions are
//! applying functions to tryte array where the result is not equal in size to the
//! input (for example uncompressing parts of the executable image).
//!
//! Marshalling
//! ~~~~~~~~~~~
//!
//! The final group of types are :cpp:class:`storage`, :cpp:class:`blob`, :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>`
//! and the rdf namespace. These allow fairly transparent (un)marshalling of all
//! important Panopticon types onto disk. The :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>` template implements a smart
//! pointer that lazily loads its instance from disk and keeps track of changes
//! on the enclosed instance. A list of all :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>` instances that are out of
//! sync with the version on disk is kept. The changes are flushed by calling
//! :cpp:func:`save_point()`.
//!
//! The instance on disk are referenced using a randomly generated UUID. The on disk
//! is an RDF graph. The graph is saved as a edge list in a embedded database. For
//! large binary objects like files the blob type is used instead of :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>`. The
//! contents of blob instances are written as files instead of putting the into the
//! database. The database and the blob files are archived using cpio and compressed
//! using LZMA.
//!
//! Each type that uses the :cpp:class:`loc\<T\>` smart pointer implements the marshal and
//! unmarshal functions that turn an instance into a edge list and a set of blob
//! instances or allocate a new instance from and edge list and blob set.
//!
//! Graphical UI
//! ------------
//!
//! The qtpanopticon application uses the functionality implemented in the
//! libpanopticon to allow browsing the disassembled code, annotated data with
//! structure definitions ("templates") and modify section and file contents.
//!
//! The UI widgets are mostly implemented in QML ("res/"), with glue classes written
//! in C++ to connect the QML code to libpanopticon. The UI includes a implementation
//! of DOT ("include/dot/" and "src/sugiyama.cc") for layouting control flow graphs.
//!
//! Moving data to QML is done by implementing Models (QAbstractModel subclasses
//! LinearModel and ProcedureModel) that return JSON encoded Javascript objects.
//! This makes memory management easier and save us from implementing dozens of
//! QObject subclasses.
